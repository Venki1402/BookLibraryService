# Book Library Service
A full stack app for library service.

### **Overview :**
This full-stack application provides a comprehensive solution for managing library services.

### Problem Statement
Currently, librarians are maintaining registers to handle book records, making it tedious to monitor loan approvals, return dates, and other related activities. The lack of a digital system leads to inefficiencies in tracking due dates, managing book availability, and calculating fines. This application aims to streamline library operations by providing a digital solution for book and loan management.
